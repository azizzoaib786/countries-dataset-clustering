# Clustering - Countries by Socio-economic and Health Indicators (Unsupervised Learning)

## Overview
This project applies unsupervised clustering techniques to categorize countries based on socio-economic and health indicators, facilitating analysis of their overall development levels.

## Project Goals
- Classify countries into meaningful clusters using unsupervised learning.
- Visualize and analyze patterns across socio-economic and health-related data.
- Utilize dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques for accurate grouping.

## Steps Included

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Initial data exploration
- Data cleaning and preprocessing

### 2. Data Visualization
- Geographical Maps
- Heatmaps
- Histograms for understanding feature distributions

### 3. Data Scaling
- Normalization to ensure equitable influence of all features

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction

### 5. Clustering Analysis
- **Elbow Method** for optimal cluster determination
- **Silhouette Score Analysis** for validating cluster quality

### 6. K-Means Clustering
- Application of the K-Means algorithm (unsupervised learning) to segment countries
